  <!-- Parameters for the multiagent mode of SaySomethingSmart

    defaultAgentsMode: Running mode of the framework
          classic     - Runs the default version of SSS (Lexical metrics, Magarreiro's)
          multi       - Runs the multiagent system, prompting the user for dialogue
          sequential  - Runs the multiagent system, reading questions from a text file sequentially
          learning    - Runs the learning system with the currently configured agents in order to learn the weights of each one
          evaluation  - Evaluates a given set of agents + weights against a set of interactions with a defined corpus. Accuracy is measured through exact matching, so it is highly recommended for the interactions to be present in the corpus

    externalAgentsPath: Path to the externalAgents folder (default is resources/externalAgents)

boss
    decisionMethod: Decision method to use. Current available decision methods are:

      SimpleMajority                    Each agent sends a single answer, and the most frequent answer given by the agents is the one delivered to the user

      PrioritySystem                    Agents have explicitly defined priorities (each agent sends a single answer);
                                        If an agent with the highest priority can answer the user's query, that answer is delivered to the user and other agents' answers are ignored;
                                        An agent with priority 1 has higher priority than an agent with priority 5;
                                        If an agent is not specified in the priority settings, the system will assume that it has a lower priority than the specified agents

      AgentMultiAnswers                 Similar to SimpleMajority, but each agent can deliver multiple possible answers instead of a single one;
                                        however, the user still only receives a single response;
10
      PrioritySystemMultiAnswers        Similar to PrioritySystem, but each agent can deliver multiple possible answers to be considered by the system instead of a single one;
                                        however, the user still only receives a single response;

      PrioritySystemDevelopmentMulti    Similar to PrioritySystemMultiAnswers, but the user receives multiple possible answers to the sent query;

      WeightedVote                      Each agent has a given weight, specified by the <weightResults> parameter; when evaluating responses, the answer with the highest sum of                                          weights between all agents will be delivered to the user
                                        Weights are usually calculated through the learning module, and must be specified in the format {'AGENT_A_NAME' : AGENT_A_WEIGHT, 'AGENT_B_NAME' : AGENT_B_WEIGHT}. Additionally, it is recommended that the sum of the agents' weights add up to 100.
                                        Weights are expressed in percentages. For example, if I have Agent1 and Agent2 in my system, and I wish to give a weight of 60% to Agent1 and a weight of 40% to Agent2, then the weight specification will be: {'Agent1': 60, 'Agent2': 40}.
                                        All of the enabled agents present in the system must be accounted for in the weight specification.

    query_agent                         The labels of the agent's domain of expertise are compared with the labels of the query, obtained from a machine learning module.
    answer_personal                     Given a set of answers, similarity measures are used to compare agents' answers to a corpus of answers. In this case, a query classified with label "PERSONAL" will be compared with a corpus of personal answers.
    answer_impersonal                   Same as answer_personal, but a query classified with label "IMPERSONAL" will be compared with a corpus of impersonal answers.
    query_answer                        The labels of the agent's answer are compared with the labels of the query, obtained from a machine learning module.
getPriorities

    answerAmount: Number of answers to be delivered to the user (1 is the default);
