Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.

R - Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed.
